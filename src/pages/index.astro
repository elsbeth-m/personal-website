			<h1>Welcome to my blog!</h1>
			<p>
				Hi! I'm Elsbeth, a cybersecurity student
				I decided to create this simple blog to keep track of some school projects that 
				I consider to be interesting. I will also add some personal research 
				on topics that I love and maybe some more security-related content. 
			</p>
			<p>
				For the moment, this website is still in progress. I haven't prepared the blog content yet, but I will very soon! 
			</p>
			<p>
				If you want to know more about me, go check out my LinkedIn profile or my GitHub repos. 
				Also, my friends and I created a CTF team, you can find us on <a href="https://ctftime.org/team/274035">CTFtime</a>  and <a href="https://www.majorleaguecyber.org/teams/systemctf">Major League Cyber</a>
