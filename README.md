# Welcome to my website! 

Thank you very much for taking the time to read my humble blog. It is truly a project that I've been eagerly anticipating for a very long time. I am very glad that I finally have the time (and a good hosting platform) to start my personal website. It's not much at the moment, but it will be. I'm planning big, exciting things for this blog.
 

## What will you find here? 
For now, the blog is meant as a personal archive for some notes, things that I learn, or things that I did, which I find interesting to share. That is actually the most important thing for me: to be able to share knowledge, opinions, and ideas with anyone who might agree or disagree with what I have to say.

So, once I start writing on this blog, you should be able to find pretty much anything, ranging from a simple, basic blog on how a computer works from a hardware point of view to some write-ups from past CTFs.

Oh! Speaking of CTFs, I'm part of an amazing team. So, if you're interested, you can check it out :  [systemctf](https://github.com/systemctf)
